# Acceptance and rollout gates

## CI and fresh install

- Backend CE typecheck and unit tests pass on Node 20.
- Frontend production build and maintained utility tests pass with Sentry upload
  variables explicitly disabled. Upstream's stale UI test suite is not a release gate.
- Production dependency audit has no critical finding.
- Secret and container scans pass.
- An empty disposable PostgreSQL volume completes base initialization and every migration.

## Security and isolation

- Public signup returns 403; a valid invitation signup succeeds.
- Session cookie attributes, CORS, CSRF, login throttling, and origin filtering pass.
- Anonymous and unauthorized object requests fail; authorized view/download URLs expire.
- Staff, Client A, and Client B fixtures prove project, task, report, search, file, and
  Socket.IO boundaries.

## Functional and operational

- Login, invitations, password resets, project/task CRUD, comments, uploads, timers,
  notifications, refresh, WebSockets, mobile layout, and reboot recovery pass.
- Disk, memory, container health, and backup freshness alerts are active.
- Immutable rollback and isolated PostgreSQL plus object-storage restore drills pass.

One internal business week without an unresolved severity-1 issue gates the designated
client pilot. The isolation review and restore drill gate all-client onboarding.
